<h2>Definitions</h2>
<ol start="1" type="I">
  <li><a name="Licensee"></a> <b>Licensee</b>
    <p> Licensee (&quot;LC&quot;) is a person, company or institution which licenses
      any of yWorks' software products, having a specified place of business resp.
      residence.
    </p><p><a name="Licensor"></a></p>
  </li>
  <li><b>Licensor</b>
    <p> Licensor is yWorks GmbH (&quot;yWorks&quot;), a German corporation, having
      a place of business in T&uuml;bingen.
    </p><p> <a name="Site"></a> </p>
  </li>
  <li><b>Site</b>
    <p> Site is defined as Licensee's specific  place of business or residence respectively.
    </p><p><a name="Software"></a> </p>
  </li>
  <li><b>Software</b>
    <p> Software means in 2nd part B: yFiles. yFiles
      is a Java class package for viewing, editing, layouting and animating graph-like
      structures. The class package is written in pure Java.
    </p><p> <a name="Documentation"></a> </p>
  </li>
  <li><b>Documentation</b>
    <p> Documentation is a manual, on-line help, or tutorial that helps a user
      learn or use the Software.
    </p> <p><a name="JavaSourceCode"></a> </p>
  </li>
  <li><b>Java Source Code</b>
    <p> Java source code is the human written or/and tool-generated Java code
      which is used as input to the Java compiler in order to produce the Java
      byte code.
    </p><p> <a name="JavaByteCode"></a> </p>
  </li>
  <li><b>Java Byte Code</b>
    <p> Java byte code is the code the Java compiler produces from Java source
      code. Java byte code is interpreted (executed) by a Java Virtual Machine
      (JVM).
    </p>
    <p> <a name="JavaProgram"></a> </p>
  </li>
  <li><b>Java Program</b>
    <p> Java program is an executable piece of Java byte code which may use (parts
      of) the software. </p><p><a name="Obfuscator"></a> </p>
  </li>
  <li><b>Java Name Obfuscation</b>
    <p>Java name obfuscation changes class, field and method names in a consistent
      but nonsensical way that does not change the functionality of the software
      but makes decompiled java code harder to read and publicly available API
      description of the original code inapplicable to the obfuscated code.
    </p><p> <a name="VersionAndUpgrades"></a> </p>
  </li>
  <li><b>Version and Upgrades</b>
    <p> A software version number consists of two or more digits. Two digits stand
      for a new version, three or more digits for a bug fix release. Bug fix releases
      refer to one software version namely to that which corresponds to the two
      leading digits of its version number. A software license is valid for only
      one version and its bug fix releases. To get a new version LCs have to license
      the upgrade of the software. In the scope of a support or subscription agreement
      software upgrades are distributed free of charge.

<h2>yFiles Licenses</h2>
<ol start="1" type="I">
  <li> <a name="yFilesSourceCodeLicense"></a><b>Source Code License</b>
    <p> A source code license gives LC the right to use yFiles as Java source
      code.
    </p>
    <p> The source code license grants LC the right to develop programs using
      yFiles. It further allows LC to use, translate, modify, create derivative
      works, and distribute such programs.
    </p>
    <p> There is no fee for users of these programs, and there are no royalties
      for selling such programs.
    </p>
    <p> The source code license grants LC the right to install and use the software
      on an arbitrary number of LC's machines in his/her site. LC
      may not sell, rent, loan or otherwise encumber or transfer the software
      in whole or in part, to a third party. Especially LC is not allowed to distribute
      (parts of) the software beyond the code being part of the program to a third
      party.
    </p>
    <p> LC is not allowed to wrap the software in a way that allows his/her customers
      to use the functionality of yFiles for software development.
    </p>
    <p>LC is entitled to deliver (parts of) yFiles together as part of his/her
      own programs only if the yFiles classes have been protected by obfuscation
      via a Java obfuscator. Minimum requirement on the obfuscation process is
      that all essential class, method, and field names of the classes belonging
      to yFiles are obfuscated. With the obfuscation it shall no longer be possible
      to use the functionality of yFiles via the publicly available yFiles API.
    </p>
    <p>The obfuscation of yFiles may be performed by any obfuscator fulfilling
      the minimum requirement as defined above. yWorks provides a cost free obfuscator
      which fulfils the minimum requirement.
    </p>
    <p> Effective date of a yFiles source code license is receipt of license payment.
    </p>
    <p>If LC is more than 10 working days in delay with a due payment yWorks shall
      be entitled to require the temporary deletion of the Software and of all
      programs developed using the Software. yWorks shall not be obliged to declare
      cancellation of the contract prior to that demand.
    </p>
    <p> <a name="yFilesByteCodeLicense"></a> </p>

      LC to use, translate, modify, create derivative works, and distribute such
      byte code and programs. There is no fee for users of these programs, and
      there are no royalties for selling such programs.
    </p>
    <p>LC may not sell, rent, loan or otherwise encumber or transfer the software
      in whole or in part, to a third party. Especially LC is not allowed to distribute
      (parts of) the software beyond the code being part of the program to a third
      party.
    </p>

    <p>The obfuscation of yFiles may be performed by any obfuscator fulfilling
      the minimum requirement as defined above. yWorks provides a cost free obfuscator
      which fulfils the minimum requirement.
    </p>
    <p> LC is not allowed to reverse-engineer, disassemble, decompile the Software,
      or otherwise attempt to derive the source code of the Software.
    </p>
    <p> Effective date of a yFiles byte code license is receipt of license payment.
    </p>
    <p> If LC is more than 10 working days in delay with a due payment yWorks
      shall be entitled to require the temporary deletion of the Software and
      of all programs developed using the Software. yWorks shall not be obliged
      to declare cancellation of the contract prior to that demand.

        <p> An extension of the trial period can be granted upon written request.
        </p>

      Any software developed under an academic yFiles license may not be transferred
      in whole or in part, to a third party being a commercial institution or
      commercially using the software. Commercial institution hereby is defined
      to be any company or organization with profit interest, commercial use is
      defined as any use within a commercial institution, any use with profit
