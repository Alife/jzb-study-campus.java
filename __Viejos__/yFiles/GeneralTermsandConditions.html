	      <a name="ObligationsAndLiabilitiesOfCustomer1"></a>
        <p>CR is obliged to support yWorks' efforts where it is necessarily required
          to fulfill its obligations. Particularly CR provides yWorks with access
          to any platform if yWorks determines that this is necessary for realization
          of its obligations.

          schedule.
        </p><p><a name="PerformanceOfOrder2"></a></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>CR accounts for the correctness and sufficiency of all transferred

  <li><b>Warranty</b>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>
        <p><a name="Warranty1"></a>  yWorks ensures that the software works according to the specifications.
          If it does not concern insignificant defects, yWorks shall remedy for
          defects of the software, to which also the lack of expressly assured
          or guaranteed properties belongs in accordance with the following paragraphs.
          Any further warranty based on defects of the delivered software is excluded.
        </p><p><a name="Warranty2"></a> </p>
      </li>
      <li><p>If the software indicates an apparent defect within 12 months after
        delivery, yWorks shall at its own option either remedy the defect or provide
        an invoice-related credit memo. </p>
        <p><a name="Warranty3"></a> </p>
      </li>
      <li><p>Notices of defects within the aforesaid scope are accepted only if they
        are made within two weeks after receipt of the product, in case of first
        not recognizable defects immediately after getting aware of the defect.
        Notices shall be in writing and shall contain all data specified in No. 4.
        </p><p><a name="Warranty4"></a> </p>
      </li>
      <li><p>
        CR provides yWorks with all data necessary to reproduce the problem
        as well as with a complete bug report. A bug report shall contain a short
        and complete program which shows the problem. yWorks rejects to enter
        into the investigation before all necessary data and documents have been
        provided. Incorrect programs modified by the customer are not examined
        by yWorks.
        </p><p><a name="Warranty5"></a></p>
      </li>
      <li><p>yWorks provides CR with all bug fix releases and patches free of charge.
        <a name="Warranty6"></a> </p>
      </li>
      <li>The guarantee is omitted regarding such programs or program sections
        which are modified or extended by CR unless CR proves that such modifications
        or extensions are not causal for the defect.

  </li>
  <li><b>Right of Withdrawal, Liability and Indemnification </b>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>
        <p><a name="LiabilityAndIndemnification1"></a> CR may withdraw from the contract, if the entire work becomes definitely
          impossible. As far as part deliveries are possible and for CR applicable
          the right of withdrawal is limited to the sections not yet accomplished.
          For already furnished part deliveries and services a claim for reimbursement
          exists to this specific extent. If yWorks chooses to remedy the deficiencies
          CR may withdraw from the contract only if the remedy failed twice. The
          liability of yWorks is omitted if CR made inappropriate modifications
          or extensions at programs or program sections.
        </p><p><a name="LiabilityAndIndemnification2"></a></p>
      </li>
      <li><p>Deviations thereof apply only for direct damages deliberately or grossly
        negligent caused by yWorks, its employees or its subcontractors, limited
        to the equivalent value of the service provided, but up to a maximum amount
        of EURO 25,000.00 in the aggregate. Any further liability is excluded.
        </p><p><a name="LiabilityAndIndemnification3"></a></p>

      <li>
        <p>Any liability for damages due to force majeure is likewise excluded. </p>
        <p><a name="LiabilityAndIndemnification4"></a></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The liability of yWorks exclusively pursues the paragraphs above. Any
          further claims not explicitly granted therein are excluded. Deviations thereof
		  solely apply if after the applicable mandatory law the liability
          may not be excluded or limited.</p>
        <p><a name="LiabilityAndIndemnification5"></a></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>CR takes note of the fact that yWorks&acute; software is neither developed
          nor intended for high risk activities such as in the operation of nuclear
          facilities, aircraft navigation, traffic control, direct life support
          machines, or weapon systems, in which the failure of the software could
          lead directly to death, personal injury, or severe physical or environmental
          damage. Any liability therefore is excluded.</p>
        <p><a name="LiabilityAndIndemnification6"></a></p>

        <p>The term "confidential information" means any information or material
          which is proprietary to OCI, whether or not developed by OCI, which
          is not generally known other than by OCI, and which DCI may obtain through
          any direct or indirect contact with OCI. </p>

        <p>DCI understands and acknowledges that the confidential information
          has been developed or obtained by OCI by the investment of significant
          time, effort and expense, and that the confidential information is a
          valuable, special and unique asset of OCI which provides OCI with a
          significant competitive advantage, and needs to be protected from improper
          disclosure. In consideration for the disclosure of the confidential
          information, DCI agrees to hold in confidence for a period of five (5)
          years and to not disclose the confidential information to any third
          person or entity without the prior written consent of OCI. No obligation

          service or item from the other party, or commercially offer any products
          using or incorporating the confidential information. This agreement
          does not create any agency, partnership, or joint venture.

      priorities, changes in law, material shortages, fire, strikes, floods, epidemics,
