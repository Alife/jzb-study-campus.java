<h1>Sample Graphs</h1>

<p>This <a href=".">directory</a> contains some sample graphs in either YGF 
(Y Graph Format) or GML (Graph Modeling Language) format.</p>

<p>Both formats are supported by yFiles and thus can be read and
written by the yED graph editor application (and with any other
application that build upon yFiles).</p>
 
<p>YGF is the "native" format of yFiles. It is 
<ul>
<li>proprietary (-)</li>
<li>non-human-readable (-)</li>
<li>compact (+)</li>
<li>powerful (+)</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
GML is an open graph interchange format not unlike XML. It is
<ul>
<li>open (+) (see <a
href="http://www.infosun.fmi.uni-passau.de/Graphlet/GML">here</a> for specification)</li>
<li>human-readable (+)</li>
<li>not so compact (-)</li>
<li>not so powerful (-)</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p> 
Note that yFiles also supports an XML-based graph format called GraphML.
The <a href="http://www.yworks.com/products/graphml">yFiles 
GraphML extension package</a> is available from our Web site.
